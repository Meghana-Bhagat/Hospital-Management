                    <p>Plummer, an internist and endocrinologist, and an early partner of the Mayo brothers, was equal parts physician and inventor.

He created the first medical record that contained the details of each patient’s history that could be easily accessed and shared by multiple doctors. It later became the model for patient records.

But Plummer’s contributions were not limited to the medical record alone. He designed several buildings and developed the pneumatic tube delivery system through which medical charts and other information could be physically transported within the Clinic.</p>
